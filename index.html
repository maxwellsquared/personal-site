        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Hi! I'm Max, and I'm a programmer and designer. I'm originally from the Bay Area, but I moved to Vancouver to go to UBC where I studied English, art, and film while volunteering for CiTR 101.9FM campus/community radio.
        </p>
        <p>After a decade of working in marketing and communications, I realised that writing code was the part of my work I loved the most, so I made the slightly terrifying decision to quit my awesome job and take a coding bootcamp.
        </p>
        <p>Some things that are important to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessibility - I want everybody to be able to enjoy the things I've made!</li>
<li>Design - I like beautiful things that are easy to use!</li>
<li>Collaboration - I love working with all kinds of people to make awesome stuff!</li>
<li>Community - I've received <em>so</em> much support from my local community and I love giving back!</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of my interests and hobbies include:</p>
<ul>
<li>VR/AR</li>
<li>AI/machine learning</li>
<li>Modelling and rendering in Blender 3D</li>
<li>Graphic design</li>
<li>3D printing</li>
<li>Making music with synthesizers, laptops, and traditional instruments</li>
<li>Deejaying (I used to be a full-time nightclub DJ!)</li>
<li>Campus/community radio</li>
<li>Drag (especially local performers!)</li>
<li>Painting little plastic elves</li>
</ul>

        <h2>Portfolio</h2>
        <p><em>This section is being added to regularly. In the meantime, please take a look at some samples of my work! As you can tell, I love working on a team. If you have any questions about what I was personally responsible for, please ask as I love talking about these projects.

        <h3>Cthulhu Teaches Typing</h3>
        <p>A couple of my friends from bootcamp are (like me) passionate about mechanical keyboards but unsatisfied with the websites we found for testing them out. We wanted a simple, clean typing test site that would save your results across time but also keep track of how you perform on different keyboards. Since it didn't exist, we built it. We also threw in plenty of fun extras like competitive multiplayer using websockets, customizable visual representations of your keyboards, graphs of your performance, and sound effects using HowlerJS. There's even a hidden easter egg if you enter the Konami Code.
        </p>
        <p>The backend is Ruby on Rails, while the frontend is a mix of JS, React, and Tailwind CSS.</p>
        <h3>Guzzlr</h3>
        <p>This portfolio project was created with friends to provide restaurant owners with a simple, SMS-enabled site to let users browse their menu and order to-go. It texts the restaurant and the client using Twilio and makes payment simple using Stripe. We went a little overboard having fun with the design‚Äìmy personal favourite is the Pepto-Bismol pink slice of pizza I modelled and rendered in Blender.
        </p>
        <h3>Reportex.ca</h3>
        <p>I led the design and maintenance of my former company's website, working with an external vendor. Once the site was complete, I was responsible for designing new pages, adding forms, and adding new functionality. I created and administered an internal wiki for our team and wrote a PHP program to automatically generate filled-in .DOCX files for our staff to send to the BC Supreme Court.
